    <h1>About ChucK Demos</h1>

    <p>The main purpose of the ChucK Demos site is to provide a repository of
      <a href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">ChucK</a> demo programs that can also be heard right
      inside the browser. Its secondary purpose is to showcase the
      <a href="https://github.com/aknuds1/chuckjs" target="_blank">ChucKJS</a> JavaScript library, which
      is made by the site's author.
    </p>

    <p>Technology-wise, the sound is completely generated (by ChucKJS) within your own browser, thanks to the nascent
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a> standard. This carries with it
    the implication that you need a modern browser
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web_Audio_API#Browser_compatibility"> that supports the
        technology</a>, to be able to play back these demos. Since the sound is synthesized within your browser,
      you must also bear in mind that the performance will depend on your computer's CPU.
